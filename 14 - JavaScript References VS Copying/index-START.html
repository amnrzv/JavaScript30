    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //const team = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    //team[2] = 'Jon';

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    team4 = [...players];

    team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const man1 = person;
    man1.age = 20;
    console.log(person, man1);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const man2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age : 45});
    console.log(person, man2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    // Poor man's cloneDeep
    const guy = {
      name : 'He Man',
      details : {
        number : [
          9878382782,
          8391738172
        ],
        email: "he@man.com",
        facebook: "he.man"
      }
    }

    const newGuy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(guy));
    newGuy.details.email = "new@guy.com";
    console.log(guy, newGuy);
